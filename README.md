# Introduction

This is Kevin's Utilities, a data structures and algorithms library written by myself in the C programming language, for use in other C projects. My intention is to, at a bare minimum, include every data structure and algorithm that would be necessary to complete any given problem on a website such as LeetCode, CodeForces, or other similar ones.

This library is actively in development at the moment, and part of my inspiration for creating it is to both refresh myself on C programming, and to use it in the next project I am planning which will require a data structures and algorithms library.
